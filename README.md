# converters_tdd
A units converter library that demonstrated TDD in python

This assignment taught me the functional process of writing tests
both failing and passig to ensure the functionality of my program 
is intact. I used Dr. Benton's solution to only write my first failing and passing
test before I was able to complete the remainder of the assignment on my own.
I did use simmilar test units as the solution but wrote the code testing such units myself.
I now believe I have a firm grasp on the idea around test driven development and 
will continue to use it moving forward.
